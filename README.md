# Hey, I'm Amar. 👋

I build AI systems that actually work.

Currently, I'm a CS student at **Texas Tech**, but I spend most of my time either training models or trying to figure out how to read brain signals (literally—I'm researching **Brain-Computer Interfaces** to see how cognitive effort affects seizure suppression).

When I'm not in the lab, I'm probably winning hackathons or shipping code.

### What I'm working on

Here’s the cool stuff I’ve been building recently:

- 🧠 **[TruthBlink](https://github.com/kushwahaamar-dev/truth)**: A bridge between Web2 social media and Web3 prediction markets. You can basically place USDC bets on viral tweets. It uses Solana Blinks and Gemini 1.5 Flash.
- 📂 **[Torpe Hitachi Classifier](https://github.com/kushwahaamar-dev/doc-classifier)**: Enterprise-grade document classification using Gemini 2.0 Flash. It’s got a full RAG pipeline and uses Solana for an immutable audit trail.
- 📊 **[LogX+ AI](https://github.com/kushwahaamar-dev/logx-)**: An AI platform that turns raw logs into structured insights. It does client-side RAG right in the browser.
- 🌊 **[BCI Signal Analysis](https://github.com/kushwahaamar-dev/bci_eeg_mfdfa)**: My research work. A Python pipeline for EEG motor imagery analysis using some heavy math (MFDFA).

### What I speak

I speak fluent **Python**, **TypeScript**, and "Machine Learning Researcher".

**My Stack:**
`Python` `TypeScript` `React` `Gemini API` `Solana` `Next.js` `PyTorch` `Scikit-learn`

### Let's chat

I'm always down to talk about AI, crypto, or neurotech.

*PS: Yes, this README is casual. I prefer building things over writing formal bios.*
